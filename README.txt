What is Easy Backup ?
	WSBackup is a Backup System for your database , it has the potential to include in any CMS System.
	To use this System you don't require any database , the only database you need is the one that you want to backup/restore etc.
How easy is to change the layout , or use the system on “my”cms?
	The system is made in such a way that it can be easily implemented to your cms or any website you have.
	We are looking in the future release to make a portable script so it will be one line script to add  to your website.
How to install?
There are only 3 step install.
PS. This step may not be required for every host .
Set permission to ./backup folder , functions/functions.php , functions/update.php

After you upload all the files and set the permissions we can setup WSBackup.
1.Go to http://yourhost/install/install.php and follow the steps ( Remember add the data to the database you want to backup/restore. )
2.Go to the page http://yourhost/bk_index.php/ and press Quick 
3.Go to Set Default and the backup file that you made should appear , press Set Default .
Please delete the install folder after the setup for safety reasons
You are done!
